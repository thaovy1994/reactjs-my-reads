# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. You'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 

# Project Overview

The main page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
Currently Reading
Want to Read
Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library. The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
